🦁 Zoo Simulator (Day 10 Project)

This is a simple **Object-Oriented Python project** where you simulate animals in a zoo using classes, inheritance, method chaining, and method overriding.

Created by **Geraldo Dieterle** on **Day 10** of my Python learning journey.

## 📦 Features

- 🧬 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ✅ Inheritance and Method Overriding
- ⛓️ Method Chaining using `return self`
- 🦁 Custom animal behaviors like `roar()`, `fly()`, `hop()`, `swim()`
- 🐍 Clean CLI interaction using print statements

---

## 💻 How It Works

Each animal is a class that inherits from a base `Animal` class:

```python
lion = Lion("Simba")
lion.eat().sleep().roar()

This allows chaining multiple actions like .eat().sleep().roar() in one line!

Lion - can roar and eat meat

Rabbit - can hop

Shark - can swim

Hawk - can fly
